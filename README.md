#Journey 🚀  

Welcome!  
This repository documents my **journey into Python and Data Science**.  
I’m starting from the basics and building up toward practical skills I can use for bigger goals in tech and aerospace (my long-term vision with [Neoventis 🌍🚀](#)).  

---

## 📌 Why I’m Doing This
1. To build a solid foundation in **Python programming**.  
2. To learn **data analysis and visualization** (using pandas, matplotlib, etc.).  
3. To create **mini-projects** that solve real problems and can grow into something bigger.  
4. To keep myself accountable by coding in public.

## 🗓 Roadmap (2 Months)
**Month 1 – Python + Data Basics**  
- Week 1: Python fundamentals (loops, lists, dicts, file handling).  
- Week 2: Pandas basics (loading, cleaning, exploring CSVs).  
- Week 3: NumPy + more pandas practice.  
- Week 4: Mini-project (simple data analysis project).  

**Month 2 – Projects & Deeper Tools**  
- Week 5: Data visualization with matplotlib & seaborn.  
- Week 6: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project.  
- Week 7: APIs & real-world datasets.  
- Week 8: Final project + write-up.
